# Decision Trees
### Consider the dataset in the following table, of houses represented by five training examples. The target attribute is 'Acceptable', which can have values 'Yes' or 'No'. This is to be predicted based on the other attributes of the house. 
#### House 	Furniture	No.rooms	New kitchen 	Acceptable
#### 1 		No 		      3 		Yes 		     Yes
#### 2 		Yes		      3 		No 		         No
#### 3 		No 		      4 		No 		         Yes
#### 4		No 		      3 		No 		         No
#### 5	    Yes 	      4 		No 		         Yes
### Compute the entropy of the target attribute
##### i.	Construct a decision tree from the above examples, that would be learned by the ID3 algorithm.
##### ii.	Show the value of information gain for each candidate attribute at each step in the construction of the tree.
